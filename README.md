🌟 Key Pillars of the Project
1. Global Intelligence
The app uses the ArcGIS engine to understand the world. Unlike basic search bars, this can resolve landmarks, specific addresses, or entire cities across the globe (e.g., searching "Eiffel Tower" to "Big Ben"). It then uses geodesic mathematics to calculate the most accurate "great-circle" distance between those coordinates.
2. The GSF Sustainability Engine (The "Brain")
This is the heart of the project. It follows the Green Software Foundation (GSF) standards to calculate a Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score.

Operational Emissions: The carbon produced by the fuel or energy used during the trip.

Embodied Emissions: The "hidden" carbon cost of the hardware (your phone or computer) used to run the routing software.
3. User ExperienceThe interface is designed with a mobile-first, "dark mode" aesthetic inspired by modern ride-sharing apps. It breaks the workflow into three logical phases:📍 Plan Trip: Search and visualize the route on an interactive map.🚗 Active Drive: A "one-tap" handoff to live GPS navigation.📊 Impact Report: A scorecard that gamifies sustainability, showing you how much $CO_2$ you've saved compared to non-optimized routes.
